# Final Revision

In Java, there are four access modifiers that determine the level of access to classes, methods, and fields. These are:

1. `public`: Public access allows a class, method, or field to be accessed from anywhere in the program.
2. `private`: Private access restricts a class, method, or field to only be accessed within the same class.
3. `protected`: Protected access allows a class, method, or field to be accessed within the same package or by a subclass in a different package.
4. `default` (also called package-private): Default access allows a class, method, or field to be accessed within the same package only.

Here are the rules for each access specifier with respect to different cases:

1. Access for classes:
    - public: A public class can be accessed from anywhere in the program.
    - private: A private class cannot be declared at the top level.
    - protected: A protected class cannot be declared at the top level.
    - default: A class with default access can be accessed within the same package only.
2. Access for fields:
    - public: A public field can be accessed from anywhere in the program.
    - private: A private field can only be accessed within the same class.
    - protected: A protected field can be accessed within the same package or by a subclass in a different package.
    - default: A field with default access can be accessed within the same package only.
3. Access for methods:
    - public: A public method can be accessed from anywhere in the program.
    - private: A private method can only be accessed within the same class.
    - protected: A protected method can be accessed within the same package or by a subclass in a different package.
    - default: A method with default access can be accessed within the same package only.
4. Access for constructors:
    - public: A public constructor can be accessed from anywhere in the program.
    - private: A private constructor can only be accessed within the same class.
    - protected: A protected constructor cannot be declared with this access modifier.
    - default: A constructor with default access can be accessed within the same package only.
5. Access for nested classes:
    - public: A public nested class can be accessed from anywhere in the program.
    - private: A private nested class can only be accessed within the same class.
    - protected: A protected nested class can be accessed within the same package or by a subclass in a different package.
    - default: A nested class with default access can be accessed within the same package only.
6. Access for derived classes:
    - public: A public member of a superclass can be accessed from a subclass in any package.
    - private: A private member of a superclass cannot be accessed by a subclass.
    - protected: A protected member of a superclass can be accessed by a subclass in a different package only through inheritance.
    - default: A member with default access in a superclass can be accessed by a subclass in the same package only through inheritance.
7. Access for classes in another package:
    - public: A public class in another package can be accessed from anywhere in the program.
    - private: A private class cannot be accessed from another package.
    - protected: A protected class cannot be declared at the top level.
    - default: A class with default access can be accessed within the same package only.

Note that these rules apply to all classes, methods, fields, constructors, and nested classes, regardless of whether they are static or instance members.
