## Welcome !!

You'll hopefully be spending your next 10 weeks on this site. So, make sure to get used to it. You may also use the discussion section to discuss any questions you may related to the GitHub Repository.

Navigate to the current week and look at the README which has a bunch of links for each date. All of the links are either website links, markdown file (.md files) or Java files (.java files).

(Don't know which week it is? Dw, I've got you covered. Each week has the dates within them)
- [Week 1](Week_1)
- [Week 2](Week_2)
- [Week 3](Week_3)
- [Week 4](Week_4)
- [Week 5](Week_5)
- [Week 6](Week_6)
- [Week 7](Week_7)
- [Week 8](Week_8)
- [Week 9](Week_9)
- [Week 10](Week_10)

For those of you who know a bit more about Github, you may choose to fork, clone or download the files from this repository but there really isn't much benefit to it. This repository is meant to access course content from anywhere/on-the-go and as a result, there are only a bunch of links and files here which don't do much together (its not like a project).
