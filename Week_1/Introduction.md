# Introduction
Hello everyone!

## About me
I'm Tejas Viswanath, a 2nd year M.S in Electrical and Computer Engineering student. My main focus is on Computer Vision, Machine Learning and Robotics.

## Structure
- Normally I would take on a few concepts and then give everyone some pseudocode or practice problem to solve so discussions sections are a mix of theory being revised and questions.
- I try to make practice problems/ demo codes for most of my discussion sections but sometimes I may not be able to do it. 
- I am usually available for student consultation even on the weekends but it depends on availability. I am usually more responsive at night, so donâ€™t think about the time, if you want me to send an email at 2:00 AM , send it through. 
- I try to help as much as I can but please be cognizant of the fact that sometimes delays can happen because of my own coursework. If I am free I do not mind helping students at any odd hours. DO NOT HESITATE TO SEND ME EMAILS ON WEEKENDS. Email me as much as you want :)

## Office hours and Help
- I will usually time with students who are unable to attend my office hours due to time conflict and give them a separate time slot based on my class schedule.
- Kindly inform me immediately via email that you are unable to attend my office hours due to time conflict in Week 1.
- I will try to keep a zoom link for the office hours and eventually send it in the announcement

## Emails
- Please to help me prioritize your emails, ie: if you need urgent attention, please include [PIC 20A-1A] [URGENT] in the subject line.
- Ideally even if you are behind and have not started the homework and it is due in 2 days ( Hey!  It happens), give me a heads up that you are running late and might need some help before submission so I at least know some students might need help near submission.
- I have received emails 1 hour before submission time, I am still willing to help if I have time but I at least need to plan and know about it.

## Important Facts to know
- In PIC 20A TAs do not grade homework. I cannot help you if you feel you have been graded unfairly . I do not process regrade requests. You can either talk to the Prof. or do a regrade request.
- Make sure your code runs on the IDE in the PIC Lab before you submit your HW.
- If an individual student has a doubt it can happen that I resolve it and post it on Github.
- Sometimes your email gets pushed down under the barrage of emails I get; I am a grad student and I get course emails too. Please send a follow-up email if you do not receive a reply in say 5-10 hours.

## Regarding what I can discuss
-  It is unfair to expect that your TA will solve the homework or directly give you hints very close to the solution. My job as a TA is to give you all the tools needed to solve the homework.
-  If you want any topic to be covered in the discussion feel free to shoot me an email requesting some time on it. Discussions are meant for more individual attention.
-  I stop the class if even one student is unable to understand something so please feel free to communicate with me, even a slightest nod is enough signal for me to try again!
-  If at any point you feel the explanations are confusing, please let me know. Your feedback is very valued , it motivates me to go back and look for an alternate explanation.

## Thank you and welcome to PIC20A Disc 1A or 1B !!
