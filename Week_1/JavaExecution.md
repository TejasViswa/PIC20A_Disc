# JDK, JRE & JVM

The JDK (Java Development Kit) is a software development kit that provides tools for developing, testing, and deploying Java applications. It includes the JRE (Java Runtime Environment) as well as development tools such as the Java compiler, debugger, and other utilities.

The JRE is a subset of the JDK and provides the minimum set of tools required to run Java applications. It includes the JVM (Java Virtual Machine), which is responsible for executing Java bytecode.

The JVM is an abstract machine that provides an environment in which Java bytecode can be executed. It interprets the bytecode and translates it into machine-specific instructions, allowing Java code to run on any platform that has a JVM installed. The JVM also manages memory, provides security features, and performs other tasks to ensure that Java programs run correctly and efficiently.

To compile a Java file, you use the Java compiler (javac) that comes with the JDK. The compiler translates the Java source code into bytecode, which can then be executed by the JVM. Once the bytecode has been generated, it can be packaged into a JAR (Java Archive) file, which can be distributed and executed on any platform that has a JVM installed.

To execute a Java file, you use the java command, which invokes the JVM and loads the bytecode into memory. The JVM then interprets the bytecode and executes the Java program. During execution, the JVM manages memory, performs garbage collection, and handles exceptions, among other tasks, to ensure that the program runs correctly and efficiently.
