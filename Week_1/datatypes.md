# Comparison of data types in C++ vs Java

 Java contains fixed sized data types, while all basic data types in C and C++ depend on the actual platform (machine architecture + operating system) the program is compiled for.

- C++ is dependent on the platform. for example - int will be in the size of the word - 32 bit or 64 bit, depends on your computer architecture.
- Java is relatively fixed - it runs on a JVM that dfines the sizes (similar to C#). They are not dependent on what OS and CPU you have.
