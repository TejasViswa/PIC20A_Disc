# README
Please refer to the dates under Spring 2023. Usually, everything that I teach during discussion will be mentioned here.

But, will it appear in your exams...? Maybe... maybe not...

Jk, I usually segregate them accordingly. Let me know if I haven't.

# Spring 2023

```java
// Your weekly joke brought to you by our friend ChatGPT
// Copy-paste and run this code on your PC once you have all of your required software installed
public class Joke {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String joke = "Why do Java developers wear glasses?\n"
                + "Because they can't C#!";
        System.out.println(joke);
    }
}
```
