```java
// Your weekly knock-knock joke brought to you by our friend ChatGPT

// ChatGPT's explanation:
// Every time you run the program, you'll get a different response for the punchline!
// You can add more responses to the responses array to make the program even more entertaining.

import java.util.Random;

public class KnockKnockJoke {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    String[] responses = {"Boo",
                          "Don't cry, it's only a joke",
                          "Gladys who? Gladys Friday, isn't it?",
                          "Lettuce in, it's cold out here!"};
    Random rand = new Random();
    int randomResponseIndex = rand.nextInt(responses.length);
    System.out.println("Knock knock!");
    System.out.println("Who's there?");
    System.out.println("Gladys.");
    System.out.println("Gladys who?");
    System.out.println(responses[randomResponseIndex]);
