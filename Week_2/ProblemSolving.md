# Problem Solving Java Puzzles

## Arrays

### Easy

1. Write a Java program to find the sum of all elements in an array.
    - Example: [1, 2, 3] => 6

2. Write a Java program to find the maximum and minimum elements in an array.
    - Example: [5, 2, 7, 1] => max: 7, min: 1

3. Write a Java program to find the second largest element in an array.
    - Example: [5, 2, 7, 1] => 5

4. Write a Java program to remove duplicates from an array.
    - Example: [1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 4, 5] => [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

### Medium

1. Write a Java program to rotate an array by k positions.
    - Example: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], k=2 => [4, 5, 1, 2, 3]

2. Write a Java program to sort an array using bubble sort.
    - Example: [5, 2, 7, 1] => [1, 2, 5, 7]

3. Write a Java program to merge two sorted arrays into a single sorted array.
    - Example: [1, 2, 4], [3, 5] => [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

4. Write a Java program to find the median of two sorted arrays.
    - Example: [1, 2], [3, 4] => 2.5

### Hard

1. Write a Java program to find the subarray with the largest sum in an array.
    - Example: [-2, 1, -3, 4, -1, 2, 1, -5, 4] => [4, -1, 2, 1] with sum 6

2. Write a Java program to find the kth smallest element in an unsorted array using quickselect algorithm.
    - Example: [7, 10, 4, 3, 20, 15], k=3 => 7

3. Write a Java program to find the majority element in an array.
    - Example: [2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2] => 2

4. Write a Java program to implement the Kadane's algorithm for finding the maximum subarray sum.
    - Example: [-2, 1, -3, 4, -1, 2, 1, -5, 4] => 6

## Strings

### Easy:

1. Write a Java program to count the number of characters in a string.
    - Example: "hello" => 5

2. Write a Java program to reverse a string.
    - Example: "hello" => "olleh"

3. Write a Java program to check if a string is a palindrome.
    - Example: "racecar" => true, "hello" => false

4. Write a Java program to convert a string to lowercase.
    - Example: "HeLLo" => "hello"

### Medium

1. Write a Java program to find the longest common prefix of two strings.
    - Example: "flower", "flow", => "flow"

2. Write a Java program to check if two strings are anagrams of each other.
    - Example: "listen", "silent" => true, "hello", "world" => false

3. Write a Java program to find the first non-repeating character in a string.
    - Example: "hello" => "h", "teeter" => "r"

4. Write a Java program to remove all white spaces from a string.
    - Example: "hello world" => "helloworld"

### Hard

1. Write a Java program to find the longest palindrome substring in a string.
    - Example: "babad" => "bab"

2. Write a Java program to find the minimum window in a string which will contain all the characters of another string.
    - Example: "ADOBECODEBANC", "ABC" => "BANC"

3. Write a Java program to implement the Rabin-Karp algorithm for pattern searching in a string.
    - Example: "hello world", "world" => 6

4. Write a Java program to find the longest repeating substring in a string.
    - Example: "banana" => "ana"
