## README

This is a simple Pokemon type effectiveness game. It is to mainly illustrate the concepts of abstract classes and interfaces (Although badly written).
Create a java project and add all the .java files under the src folder and run the `PokemonGame.java` to see the output.

Please tweak the code as you wish to see more types/pokemon or to even implement a pokemon battle!

You should see an output like this:
```
Charmander (Fire) vs. Bulbasaur (Grass)
Bulbasaur took 40 damage!
Charmander's attack against Bulbasaur did 40.0 damage.
Charmander took 10 damage!
Bulbasaur's attack against Charmander did 5.0 damage.
```
